Apple Catcher! Game

This game is a game where you have 15 seconds to catch as many apples as you can before time runs out. (NOTE: This game runs best in the Unity Game Screen as a Standalone 1024 x 768. I ran it on my own computer as custom dimensions 2048 x 1572)

You start the game by pressing the START button on the starting screen. After a few seconds, apples will begin to fall in a random pattern across the screen. You use your mouse to move the basket along the bottom of the screen and catch the apples. Be careful! The apples use real physics and can bounce out of the basket so be careful not to punch them away! After time runs out, your score will be displayed at the top left corner of the screen and it will say GAME OVER so that you can start again by pressing the RESTART button. It’s simple but fun! 

Resources that I used to create this game include the various Unity Tutorials for making 2D games as well as the Unity API library for many of my functions to make the game work. I contributed my own art made with Krita on Mac. I then imported it as a Sprite type and created prefabs from the “apple” sprite to be spawned. 

What I have learned from this assignment is that even the most simple of game, 2D or 3D, requires a lot of thought as well as intricate coding to make it work as cleanly and smoothly as possible. There are many different ways to make the same game as well, making each game a unique and individual effort. 

If I were to improve this game further, it would be to add apple types that would negatively effect the points of the game. I tried to do this using the different references to triggers and collisions and my “rotten apple” sprite can be seen in the assets —> images folder. However, I was not able to make it work successfully before the turn in date. I would also add a further menu to save high scores as well as difficulty settings so that apples fall faster or slower or at different rates.
